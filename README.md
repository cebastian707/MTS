This project is a Turing machine that has one and two tape turing machine. It is inspired by https://morphett.info/turing/turing.html#LoadMenu and uses his UI. This code uses react as the frame work as a way to modernize the code. You can either choose between doing a one tape turing machine or using a two tape turing machine. The functionality of the page has a control that let's you step into the turing machine at each step, reset the turing machine , start which runs at full speed, stop which halts the turing machine and choose between a one tape turing machine or two tape functionality. Syntax information can be found at the bottom of the page.
